    "I created 8 different CTE in one query, all connected by the patientunitstayID. Below is a detailed explanation of each CTE:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`upd_vitalperiodic`**:\n",
    "    - **Purpose**: Cleans and processes the vital signs data.\n",
    "    - **Details**:\n",
    "        - Selects vital signs from the `vitalperiodic` table.\n",
    "        - Ensures the values of vital signs fall within valid ranges by setting values outside these ranges to `NULL`.\n",
    "        - If there are missing value, then uses the `LAST_VALUE` window function to carry forward the last non-`NULL` value for each vital sign within each `patientunitstayid` partition.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`vt`**:\n",
    "    - **Purpose**: Aggregates the processed vital signs data into hourly intervals.\n",
    "    - **Details**:\n",
    "        - Groups the `upd_vitalperiodic` data into 1-hour intervals (each interval represents 60 minutes).\n",
    "        - Calculates the median value of each vital sign within each interval.\n",
    "        - Joins the `patient` table to filter records based on `observationoffset` constraints (Take only the Vital recorded before patient discarded, as vital may include multiple visits).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`upd_laboratory`**:\n",
    "    - **Purpose**: Cleans and processes the laboratory test results.\n",
    "    - **Details**:\n",
    "        - Selects laboratory test results from the `lab` table.\n",
    "        - Ensures the lab results fall within valid ranges by setting values outside these ranges to `NULL`.\n",
